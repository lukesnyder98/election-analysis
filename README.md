2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Election-Audit Summary
I propose that with some modifications, this script could be used for any election. To use the script on another state's congressional election, the value of the file_to_load variable would need to be changed to the name of a new CSV file with the results of that state's election, provided that the CSV file follows the same format as the current election_results.csv. 

If this script were to be used on the presidential election, the county vote counts and percentages could be replaced with the vote counts and percentages for each district in a certain state. Alternatively, it could calculate the total votes for each state and return the state with the highest turnout. The script would need to be modified further to give each presidential candidate the corresponding number of electoral college votes once they have won a certain state, and then return their total number of electoral college votes.
